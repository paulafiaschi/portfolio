        <h4>Focus on color choice and animations</h4>
        <p>The assignment was to apply a color palette to a mockup landing page design, then create a dark theme that
          would also suit the design and finally, add animatioons to guide the user's attention . </p>

    <h3>Color palette</h3>
    <div class="two-col">
      <p>One of the primary tasks when creating a website is to ensure that the user gets the right message in the right
        way. And one of the biggest factors in this is by using the right colors.
      </p>
      <p>The content was only lorem impsum, thus making it difficult to select colors that would match the
        client. However, following the 60-30-10 rule, I chose a color scheme that would have enough contrast to make it
        work on the website.</p>

    <h3>Dark Theme</h3>
    <div class="two-col">
      <p>Dark mode has become one of the most often requested app and website design features. On most devices/operating
        systems, users can enable dark mode at a system level. This usually works system-wide, including default and
        third-party apps.</p>
      <p> This is why, I created the dark theme based on the user's preferred color scheme. However, I also added a
        toggle button to the menu bar to give the user the ability to choose.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Animations</h3>
    <div class="two-col">
      <p>Animations are very useful to improve the UX/UI of a website. Users not only feel attracted to these animated
        designs, but they value the innovation and smoothness placed on different steps throughout the site.</p>
      <p>For example, a hover effect placed on the menu bar quickly shows the user which elements are clickable and
        catches the user's attentions. On mobile, however, we loose that possibility. That is why the other animations
        play a big role since they amaze the user and keep them interacting. </p>
