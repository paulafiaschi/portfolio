        <h4>Focus on typeface pairing and UI card design</h4>
        <p>The assignment was to create a mockup landing page design, choosing the right font pairing. There were two
          parts;
          first part was to implement a font hierarchy and the second part to design UI cards.</p>

    <h3>Font pairing and hierarchy</h3>
    <p>Good typography not only makes the user read, but also feel. It allows the user to focus on the content and it
      affects how it is understood and perceived. It sets the personality of the website and affects the user’s overall
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>I started choosing the body font because it is the most common element in any product. The looking feel of the
      body text has the greates impact. Therefore, I chose a sans-serif font which gives a modern look and it is easy to
      read on screen.</p>

    <h3>UI Design Card</h3>
    <p>Cards were one of the main focus of this assignment and that it why their design was fundamental. They take
      little space but show enough information so that the user can choose between two choices. The design is simple,
      yet visually pleasing, with a picture catching the user’s atention. They keep the interface organized and they
      tend to be minimalistic to keep the design clean. In this case, there were plenty of them and that is why I chose
      to stick to minimalism and just one of the accent colors.</p>

    <p>Because cards are so minimal, contrast plays a major role in dividing information and giving priorities. I chose
      to stick to only two hues and play with the values together with font size to create the hierarchy.</p>
    <p>It is important to make sure that the cards are responsive, and that the user can access them from any device.

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <p>Even though the content was only lorem impsum, thus making it difficult to select colors that would match the
      topic, and, following the 60-30-10 rule, these is the color scheme chosen for the website.</p>
