        <h4>Focus on typeface pairing and UI card design</h4>
        <p>The assignment was to create a mockup landing page design, choosing the right font pairing. There were two
          parts;
          first part was to implement a font hierarchy and the second part to design UI cards.</p>

    <h3>Font pairing and hierarchy</h3>
    <div class="two-col">
      <p>Good typography not only makes the user read, but also feel. It allows the user to focus on the content and it
        affects how it is understood and perceived. It sets the personality of the website and affects the user's
        overall
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>I started choosing the body font because it is the most common element in any product. The looking feel of the
        body text has the greates impact. Therefore, I chose a sans-serif font which gives a modern look and it is easy
        to
        read on screen.</p>

    <h3>UI Design Card</h3>
    <div class="two-col">
      <p>Cards were one of the main focus of this assignment and that it why their design was fundamental. They take
        little space but show enough information so that the user can choose between two choices.</p>
      <p> The design is simple,
        yet visually pleasing, with a picture catching the user's atention. They keep the interface organized and they
        tend to be minimalistic to keep the design clean. In this case, there were plenty of them and that is why I
        chose
        to stick to minimalism and just one of the accent colors.</p>

    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <img src="/img/buttons.png" alt="Primary, secondary and terciary buttons">

    <div class="two-col">
      <p>To ensure that a wider audience can read small text (18px and under), it should have a colour contrast ratio of
        at least 4.5:1. In this case, the secondary's and the terciary's buttons have a slightly different value in
        order
        to achieve that ratio, yet maintaining the same hue.</p>
      <p>They all have different sttyle so that they don't break the visual hierarchy by conflicting. It is clear which
        action is the most important.
        When it comes to accessibility, it's important that we don't rely on colour alone to distinguish interface
        elements. Those who are colourblind wouldn't be able to tell the difference between elements. </p>

  <section class="color-palette">
    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <p>The content was only lorem impsum, thus making it difficult to select colors that would match the
      topic, and, following the 60-30-10 rule, this is the color scheme chosen for the website.</p>
